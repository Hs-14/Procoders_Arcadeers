### Setting up the program
  1. Download the code and make sure you have the latest version of Python3.
  2. Add python and pip to your system path(if they are not already).
        The provided link demonstrates how to add python to the path: https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ - automatic!
  3. Install the PyGame Library onto your system.
      * You can download the wheel file from the website: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
        and use the following command to add the pygame library to python:
        ```shell
        pip install pygame‑2.0.1‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl
        ```
        The name of the wheel file may vary with the version of the python you have and whether your system is 32 bit or 64 bit.
      * Or you can simply use the following command
        ```shell
        pip install pygame
        ```
  4. After the prerequisites are complete we are now ready to run the program.
    Run the \_main.py and you are ready to have some great time.
